# Uncharted-4-Debug-enabler
This will patch uncharted 4 eboot to have the debug menu enable

Tested and known to be working on CUSA00341 V1.0 others likey have different values so its highly likey other CUSA will fail or it will corrupt the given elf

Usage: Uncharted_4_1.00_Debug_enabler.exe "eboot.bin"


the output hash(MD5) *should* be ``7c58535522090a1dfc082fceecf45c7e`` though this could likey change if used on different region CUSA's
